This is an example project demonstrating how to use the Framebuffer 
Object extension in OpenGL.

It uses GLee by Ben Woodhouse for extension setup and requires some form
of the GLUT library to be compiled and run.

The program was developed using FreeGLUT avaible from 
http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/

Extension Spec :
