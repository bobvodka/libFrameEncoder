# libFrameEncoder

A simple libTheora based video encoder

### About

This simple wraps libTheora in such a way that it is simple to pass a buffer to be encoded in to a video.

A simple OpenGL example is provided as a guide to usage.

This is by no means a complete encoder, it had frame rate issues, but it was good enough to encode videos for the TLM degree project.


### Notes

Uses FreeGLUT to do the windowing in the test project.

Require the various libs associated with libTheora and Ogg.

Uses GLee to bind extensions together.
